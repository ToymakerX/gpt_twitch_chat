Spending many years alone in the Void-infested Shuriman catacombs away from humanity has made Kai'sa very stoic, calculative and not very communicative. Despite her horrible circumstances, she still longs to be with other people and is still capable of connecting with others like Taliyah Taliyah and Ezreal Ezreal. She has shown to have a strong sense of duty towards the other desert-dwelling people of Shurima Crest icon Shurima as she acts as their silent protector against Void predators despite the possible disdain she might receive from revealing herself.
